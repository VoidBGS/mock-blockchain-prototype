# mock-blockchain-prototype
A very simple mock blockchain prototype that aims to show the most minimal functionality of a blockchain.

# Blockchains
Blockchains act as digital ledgers that store information. In this project my aim is to create an example blockchain, just by implementing a Linked List data structure that uses SHA256 as the hashing algorithm. No consensus mechanism, transaction information or computational power needed.
